# General
This repository is a portfolio of a number of projects that I have worked on over the years and is intended for use in job searching and the like. Files fall into a mixture of different types, some are coding projects, some are writeups of CTFs, some are training documents that I have produced. Where possible I have included documentation that belongs with each of the projects, most of the things in this repository will only be uploaded here after they are finished, where possible I will upload a document describing the commit history for files that were uploaded to git hub throughout their creation.

## Formatting Quirks
Almost all of the markdown that exists in this repository was written in the program Obsidian and so has formatting quirks unique to the markdown specs of that program

# Folders
I have tried to divide the folder into different specialties, the main branches being Software dev and cybersecurity although there is obvious overlap between the two and for most of the applications that I have developed here I have tried, where relevant, to apply the principles of secure software dev.

## Cyber Security 
The Cybersecurity folder contains mostly write-ups sorted into sub categories, red-team for writeups of CTF type event writeups and bug bounty (i.e. documented processes for finding vulnerabilities in systems), blue-team for write ups of cyber security projects (things like setting up a SIEM on my home network or the like) and general for other writing that I have done for cybersecurity (such as training materials)

## Software Development
This folder is divided by projects by both general area (i.e web-dev, GUI applications, networking) and by technology used (i.e. Python). As well as software and applications it also contains some scripts that I developed with a brief description of what they do and how they work
