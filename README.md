# General
This repository is a portfolio of a number of projects that I have worked on over the years and is intended for use in job searching and the like. Files fall into a mixture of different types, some are coding projects, some are writeups of CTFs, some are training documents that I have produced. Where possible I have included documentation that belongs with each of the projects, most of the things in this repository will only be uploaded here after they are finished, where possible I will upload a document describing the commit history for files that were uploaded to git hub throughout their creation.

## Formatting Quirks
Almost all of the markdown that exists in this repository was written in the program Obsidian and so has formatting quirks unique to the markdown specs of that program

# Cyber Security 
The Cybersecurity folder contains mostly write-ups sorted into sub categories, red-team for writeups of CTF type event writeups and bug bounty (i.e. documented processes for finding vulnerabilities in systems), blue-team for write ups of cyber security projects (things like setting up a SIEM on my home network or the like) and general for other writing that I have done for cybersecurity (such as training materials)

# Coding
This folder is divided by projects by Project
