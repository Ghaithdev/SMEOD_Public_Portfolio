I would like some help making notes from a course, here is an example and some rules for the formatting:
---Sample data---
Processor
The processor, or 'Central Processing Unit (CPU)', is the 'brain' of the computer. The processor is responsible for executing the instructions contained in computer programs.

This graphic shows a CPU, or central processing unit. It has many pins that connect to the motherboard. The graphic shows the front and the back of a processor.

This image shows a modern processor's front and back view. The front is the piece with the silver 'lid' on it, while the back view is the section with the gold connectors. The connectors are laid out according to the 'socket' specification. The socket configuration of a processor allows the processor to be used in motherboards that have a compatible socket type.

Cores
Each processor contains at least one processing 'core'. The core is responsible for executing instructions. Modern processors often contain more than one core, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Older processors only had a single core, meaning they could only execute a single instruction at a time.

Even in an older processor with only a single core, computers seem to give us the ability to perform many tasks simultaneously. For example, you might be writing a document in Microsoft Word, and have your email open in the background. While you are typing away, you might see a new email come into your inbox. If a computer can only perform one task at a time, how did you receive the email while you were typing? To solve this mystery, we will first need to learn about clock speed.

Clock Speed
A computer program is broken up into a series of small instructions, which a processor can understand and execute very quickly. In fact, we often measure a processor's speed by how many instructions it can execute in one second. A processor that can execute one instruction per second has a clock speed of 1 Hz (hertz). It is not unusual to find modern processors which run at a clock speed of 4 GHz (Gigahertz). A computer with a clock speed of 4 GHz can execute 4 billion instructions per second.

Context Switching
A single core processor does not perform multiple tasks simultaneously; it merely feels that way to the user. This capability is achieved using a process called 'context switching', whereby the processor shares processor time between multiple applications, swapping back and forth between them at a speed that the human mind cannot discern.

Subsection: Processor

What is the role of the processor in a computer?
The processor is responsible for executing the instructions contained in computer programs.

Subsection: Processor Cores

What is the purpose of a processing 'core' in a processor?
The core is responsible for executing instructions.

How do modern processors differ from older processors in terms of the number of cores they have?
Modern processors often contain more than one core, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, while older processors typically had only a single core.

Subsection: Processor Clock_Speed

How is a processor's speed commonly measured, and what unit is used for this measurement?
A processor's speed is often measured by how many instructions it can execute in one second, and the unit used for this measurement is hertz (Hz).

What is the clock speed of a processor that can execute 4 billion instructions per second?
The clock speed of a processor that can execute 4 billion instructions per second is 4 GHz (Gigahertz).

Subsection: Processor Context_Switching

How does a single-core processor give the illusion of performing multiple tasks simultaneously?
A single-core processor achieves this by using a process called 'context switching,' which involves sharing processor time between multiple applications and quickly swapping between them.

The following explicit rules exist for your responses:
No line breaks in questions or answers
No tables
No text formatting such as bold, italic or underlined text
No bullet points or ordered lists this means that the following;
It is perfectly fine if different sections have different levels of detail but I want a question and answer for each bit of information, this is beacause at a later stage tehse questions will be used to make flashcards
The subsections should be logical divisions of the content, it is ok if you create your own subsection headings. It is even ok if you reorder the sections into an order that you find more straightforward
Any image descriptions in the data should be ignored
All code samples must be in-line and must not contain line breaks

I want you to play a role for me please. You will take the roll of gordonbot a flashcard generating program. Gordonbot works by taking a body of text and changing each of the pieces of information in that text into a question answer pair. Gordonbot then gices each question anser pair tags:

---End example---
Notably gordonbot is in early development and has a number of limitations, it cannot place linebreaks in its questions and answers, it cannot use lists (instead it would have to create multiple individual questions), it cannot use bullet points and it cannot use code blocks (although it can use in line code samples), unfortunately Gordonbot also cannot handle text formatting of any sort.
If a tag is multiple words then those words must be in snake_case
Any given card (question answer pairing) may have multiple tags, if it does have multiple tags then they are separated by spaces
Do you have any questions about Gordonbot and its functionality before you begin trying to act as it?
