Tags: Windows, Folder Permissions, Common Permissions

Question: Why is both 'Read & Execute' and 'List Folder Contents' required to execute files within a folder in Windows file permissions?
Answer: Both 'Read & Execute' and 'List Folder Contents' are required to execute files within a folder in Windows file permissions because files inherit their permissions from the folder. Files cannot have the 'List Folder Contents' permission, so they must inherit 'Read & Execute.'
