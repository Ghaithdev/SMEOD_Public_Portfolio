Subsection: Web Servers Overview

What is the primary function of web servers in the context of web page requests?
Web servers are software applications that accept and process HTTP requests, sending back HTML (or other content) to browsers, which use it to render web pages.

What are the two main types of web servers mentioned?
The two main types of web servers discussed are generic web servers and custom web servers.

Subsection: Generic Web Servers

Can you name two popular generic web server products?
Two popular generic web server products are Apache and Nginx.

What is the role of the "web root" folder in generic web servers?
In generic web servers like Apache and Nginx, the "web root" folder serves as the base directory containing the files needed to run a website. It typically includes an index file, such as index.html or index.php, which is sent as a response when a request is made to '/'.

Do generic web servers require programming knowledge for setup and configuration?
No, generic web servers are easy to set up and do not require programming knowledge for basic configuration. They serve files from a specified folder.

Subsection: Custom Web Servers

How do custom web servers differ from generic web servers in terms of serving web content?
Custom web servers are purpose-built programs that are designed to serve specific sites. They typically require the routes and behavior to be programmed directly into the software. The code of the web server defines how it responds to user requests for specific paths or routes.

What advantages do custom web servers offer compared to generic web servers?
Custom web servers offer more flexibility and customization options. They can be tailored to the specific needs of a site or web application, allowing for the addition of necessary features and the exclusion of unnecessary ones.

What is a potential downside of using custom web servers?
A downside of using custom web servers is that they require programming skills to set up and configure, making them less accessible to individuals without programming knowledge.

Subsection: Port

Which ports are commonly used by web servers for HTTP and HTTPS traffic?
Web servers commonly use port 80 for HTTP (Unencrypted) traffic and port 443 for HTTPS (Encrypted) traffic.

Is it possible for web servers to listen on non-standard ports, and how is this indicated in URLs?
Yes, web servers can be configured to listen on non-standard ports. To access a website served on a non-standard port, users need to specify the port number in the URL, like "https://some-fake-domain.fake:8008," where "8008" is the port number.

Subsection: Cookies

What is the purpose of a cookie in the context of web browsing?
A cookie is a tiny file that a web server can create on a visitor's computer to hold a small amount of data. Commonly, cookies are used to save a unique identifier, such as a session ID, to track user sessions and login status.

Why do cookies typically have an expiry date, and how does it affect a user's login session?
Cookies have an expiry date set by the site that creates them. This date allows a user to remain logged in even after closing the browser, as long as they return to the site within the cookie's expiration timeframe.

How can cookies be used for tracking purposes, especially in the context of advertising?
Cookies can be used for tracking by advertising companies. When ads are embedded from an advertising company's server on various websites, the company can give users a tracking cookie through the ad. This cookie allows the advertising company to identify users across different sites and serve targeted ads based on their browsing history.

Subsection: Local Storage

What is local storage in the context of web browsing, and how much data can it store?
Local storage allows websites to store files on a user's computer within the browser, with a total file size limit of 5MB.

How does local storage differ from cookies in terms of user awareness and tracking?
Local storage can be a sneakier way to track users because many people are aware of cookies and may clear them to prevent tracking. However, fewer people are aware of local storage, so they may not know to clear it to protect their privacy.

What are some common uses of local storage in web applications, aside from tracking?
Local storage is often used to power richer web application interactions, providing more substantial and powerful storage for web applications. It enables various functionalities beyond tracking, contributing to the complexity of modern web browsers and applications.
