What are the primary scoring metrics used in CVSS to assess vulnerability severity?; The primary scoring metrics include Base, Temporal, and Environmental metrics, which consider aspects like exploitability, impact, and the environment in which the vulnerability exists.; CVSS Scoring_Metrics Base Temporal Environmental Exploitability Impact
What are some key differences between CVSS Version 2 and CVSS Version 3?; CVSS Version 3 introduced a more granular scoring system, accounting for factors like privileges required, user interaction, and the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.; CVSS2 CVSS3 Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System Version_2 Version_3 Granular Scoring_Practices Privileges User_Interaction CIA_Triad
What does the CVSS Base Score represent in both CVSS2 and CVSS3?; The CVSS Base Score represents the intrinsic severity of a vulnerability and is a key component used for prioritizing remediation efforts.; CVSS Base_Score Intrinsic_Severity Prioritization Remediation
What do the Temporal and Environmental metrics in CVSS3 assess?; The Temporal metrics consider factors like exploit code maturity and remediation level, while the Environmental metrics account for the specific impact of a vulnerability in a particular environment.; CVSS3 Temporal_Metrics Environmental_Metrics Exploit_Code_Maturity Remediation_Level Specific_Impact Environment
How is CVSS used in cybersecurity practices?; CVSS is used to standardize the assessment of vulnerability severity, enabling organizations to prioritize patching and mitigation efforts based on risk.; CVSS Use_Cases Cybersecurity Vulnerability_Severity Prioritization Patching Mitigation
How is the CVSS vector used to calculate the CVSS Base Score?; The CVSS vector comprises several metrics, each with a specific value, which is used to calculate the CVSS Base Score using a formula specified in the CVSS documentation.; CVSS Vector Score_Calculation Metrics Formula Documentation
What are some benefits of using CVSS Version 3 over earlier versions?; CVSS3 provides more accurate and granular vulnerability assessments, enabling organizations to make better-informed decisions about vulnerability remediation.; CVSS3 Benefits Accuracy Granularity Better-Informed_Decisions Remediation
What are the key components of the CVSS3 vector, and what do they represent?; The CVSS3 vector comprises Base, Temporal, and Environmental components. The Base component represents intrinsic vulnerability characteristics, Temporal considers temporal factors, and Environmental reflects environmental specifics.; CVSS3 CVSS_Vector Base Temporal Environmental Vulnerability_Characteristics Temporal_Factors Environmental_Specifics
What are the Base metrics in CVSS3, and how do they contribute to the Base Score?; The Base metrics in CVSS3 include Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, each contributing to the calculation of the Base Score.; CVSS3 Base_Metrics Attack_Vector Attack_Complexity Privileges_Required User_Interaction Scope Confidentiality Integrity Availability Base_Score
What does the Attack Vector (AV) metric assess in CVSS3, and what are its possible values?; The Attack Vector assesses how an attacker reaches the vulnerable component. Its values include Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), and Physical (P).; CVSS3 Attack_Vector AV Vulnerable_Component Values Network Adjacent Local Physical
What does the Attack Complexity (AC) metric evaluate in CVSS3, and what are its possible values?; Attack Complexity assesses how complex an attacker's exploitation process is. Its values include Low (L), High (H), and Required (R).; CVSS3 Attack_Complexity AC Exploitation_Process Values Low High Required
What does the Privileges Required (PR) metric analyze in CVSS3, and what are its potential values?; Privileges Required assesses the level of privileges an attacker must have to exploit a vulnerability. Values include None (N), Low (L), and High (H).; CVSS3 Privileges_Required PR Level_Of_Privileges Values None Low High
What does the User Interaction (UI) metric examine in CVSS3, and what are its available values?; User Interaction assesses whether user interaction is required for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability. Values include None (N), Required (R), and Unspecified (U).; CVSS3 User_Interaction UI Requirement User_Involvement Values None Required Unspecified
What does the Scope (S) metric determine in CVSS3, and what are its potential values?; The Scope metric indicates whether the exploitation of a vulnerability impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component. Values include Unchanged (U) and Changed (C).; CVSS3 Scope S Impact On_Resources Values Unchanged Changed
How do the Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), and Availability (A) metrics contribute to the CVSS3 Base Score?; These metrics assess the impact of an exploitation on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources, with values including High (H), Low (L), and None (N).; CVSS3 Confidentiality Integrity Availability Impact Values High Low None
How is the CVSS3 Base Score calculated using the Base metrics?; The Base Score is calculated using a formula that takes into account the impact and exploitability of a vulnerability based on the values of the Base metrics.; CVSS3 Base_Score Calculation Formula Impact Exploitability Base_Metrics
