**New month new tips!**

This month we want to give you the toolset to protect yourself from scam calls.

Each year around the world billions of dollars are lost worldwide to scammers. Even though they aren't the most sophisticated form of attack, phone scams are still the most common form of successful scam and with voice cloning AI tools they are likely to get worse. 

We have 3 tips for you to help you protect yourself from these scams but if you remember only one thing let it be this:

**_DO NOT GIVE MONEY OR INFORMATION UNLESS YOU ARE CERTAIN WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO_**

### 1. Check who is calling you

 > [!Client Request] 
 > Can you investigate if the premium line and expenses are applicable here? 


>[!My response]
>It seems that scammers work in cahoots with a local phone company that they split the profits with which is why the numbers are almost never from the victims country

**_You look at your phone after you get out of the shower and see a missed call from a foreign country, you have a trip there in two weeks and your phone says the call is from the visa office, they left an urgent sounding voicemail. You notice the number isn’t the one you called last time. Should I call back? It sounds important ..._** 

The scam is simply deliberately giving someone a missed call from premium line, when people called back they were kept on hold for around half an hour at which point they had a substantial bill.  Often scammers leave urgent sounding voicemails and will spoof calls to seem like they are from important institutes. Parents with children studying abroad are especially likely to be targeted by this scam. Unfortunately scammers are often working with the phone companies they get the number from so you are unlikely to get a refund

Note: Even if your phone says who the call is from, this can be spoofed, look up the number on a search engine or even look up the number of the organisation that is written next to the phone number and if the phone number is different to what you have seen before then call back on the one you know

### 2. Never give information to someone who called you

**_Your bank calls you and tells you there’s been suspicious activity on your account, they tell you that in order to continue they need your account number, name and date of birth._**

This seems like it could be legitimate but thinking about it your bank knows your account number, if they called you they would already know who you were. Scammers want something they can use to make money and information can be a better way of making money from you than stealing money. You should still avoid making payments though especially via untraceable methods like vouchers, gift cards or cryptocurrency. 

They will try and get you to give up login information, bank details or other secret information so they can use that information to steal from you or an organisation you work for. 

Often they will do this while pressing some sense of urgency (late payment, suspicious activity or viruses on your device are all common excuses) and become impatient or aggressive if you delay. If you feel someone putting pressure on you or they ask for information they should already have, hang up and call whoever they said they were from a phone number you look up yourself.

---

### 3. Never allow remote connection to your device from someone who contacted you unexpectedly

**_John from Microsoft calls and tells you that they have detected a virus on your device. He tells you that they need to set up a connection on team viewer so he can look more closely at your computer._**

The only time you give control of your device to someone else (e.g using applications to allow remote access and control such as Team Viewer) is when you know exactly who they are and either you initiated contact with them or were expecting the call. 

Note: The statement “something is wrong with your Microsoft device” is vague, most people have a Microsoft device. Look out for vague statements and challenge people to be more specific “John” likely doesn’t know whether you have a Microsoft device let alone what type it is

While the tips for this month are catered toward voice/phone phishing scams many of them will apply in other situations such as email

The most important thing to remember:

**_DO NOT GIVE MONEY OR INFORMATION UNLESS YOU ARE CERTAIN WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO_**

Stay vigilant, stay safe!

This month we want to give you the toolset to protect yourself from scam calls.

Each year around the world billions of dollars are lost worldwide to scammers. Even though they aren't the most sophisticated form of attack, phone scams are still the most common form of successful scam and with voice cloning AI tools they are likely to get worse. 

We have 3 tips for you to help you protect yourself from these scams but if you remember only one thing let it be this:

***DO NOT GIVE MONEY OR INFORMATION UNLESS YOU ARE CERTAIN WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO***

## Never give information to someone who called you

***Your bank calls you and tells you there’s been suspicious activity on your account, they tell you that in order to continue they need your account number, name and date of birth.*** 

Should you give them this info?

This seems like it could be legitimate but thinking about it your bank knows your account number, if they called you they would already know who you were. Scammers want something they can use to make money and information can be a better way of making money from you than stealing money.  

They will try and get you to give up login information, bank details or other secret information so they can use that information to steal from you or an organisation you work for. 

Often they will do this while pressing some sense of urgency (late payment, suspicious activity or viruses on your device are all common excuses) and become impatient or aggressive if you delay. If you feel someone putting pressure on you or they ask for information they should already have, hang up and call whoever they said they were from a phone number you look up yourself.

## Make payments only via bank transfer or trusted platforms

***You get a call from your electric company saying that your are late on payments and they will shut off your power if you don’t pay them €2000 in iTunes vouchers***

Should you pay up?

Once again we see a sense of urgency being pushed, a hallmark of scams. They use this urgency to push you to make a payment in a strange method, why? 

Because gift cards, vouchers, bitcoin and other crypto currencies are all untraceable and hard or impossible to reverse. 

Note: “Final Warnings” are rarely over the phone and if they are they are almost always preceded by letters or emails

---
## Never allow remote connection to your device from someone who contacted you unexpectedly

***John from Microsoft calls and tells you that they have detected a virus on your device. He tells you that they need to set up a connection on team viewer so he can look more closely at your computer.***

Should you cooperate?

The only time you give control of your device to someone else (Team Viewer does exactly this) is when you know exactly who they are and either you initiated contact with them or were expecting the call. Team viewer and other similar programs are not fundamentally different than viruses and malware in the remote control they give to the other side.

Note: Microsoft devices are very common so assuming that any given number will have one is safe, look out for and challenge vague or non-specific statements.

## Do not call unknown numbers

***You look at your phone after you get out of the shower and see a missed call from Australia, your child is studying abroad there so you think it is relating to her. ***

Should you call the number back?

An increasingly common type of scam has been dubbed “One Ring”. The original reporting on this showed it being used on the parents of Japanese students studying abroad in Australia but it could work on almost anyone. The scam is simply deliberately giving someone a missed call from premium line, when people called back they were kept on hold for around half an hour at which point they had a substantial bill. 

 Note: Even if your phone says who the call is from, this can be spoofed, look up the number on a search engine or even look up the number of the organisation that is written next to the phone number.
